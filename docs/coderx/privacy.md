## Privacy Policy

Coderx for GitHub is a concise and powerful GitHub app. You can use it to do a number of things in GitHub. 

This privacy policy applies to the iOS main app itself and its embedded frameworks.

**iCloud Sync**

Coderx uses iCloud to back up and sync your favorites. The iCloud service is provided by Apple, and as we can imagine, it's quite secure and trustworthy.

Note: Prior to version 3.8.0 we used our own server to back up and sync your favorites. After version 3.8.0, we switched to iCloud to save and sync your favorites in a more privacy-friendly way.

**Data Collected by Coderx**

The Coderx app itself does not collect any data from you. This includes data used to calculate and track the number and behavior of users, as well as statistics on application crashes.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
