## Privacy Policy

AioTools is an app that will contain a lot of tools (We actually expect it contains all tools, this is why we call it "Aio"(All in one)). 

**Data Collected by AioTools**

The AioTools app itself does not collect any data from you. This includes data used to calculate and track the number and behavior of users, as well as statistics on application crashes.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
