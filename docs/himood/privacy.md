## Privacy Policy

Himood is a "minimalist" mood tracking application. You only need to swipe left or right on the mood ball to create your current mood.

This privacy policy applies to the iOS main app itself and its embedded frameworks.

**iCloud Sync**

Himood uses iCloud to back up and sync data. The iCloud service is provided by Apple, and as we can imagine, it's quite secure and trustworthy.

**Data Collected by Himood**

The Himood app itself does not collect any data from you. This includes data used to calculate and track the number and behavior of users, as well as statistics on application crashes.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
